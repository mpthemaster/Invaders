Invaders
========

Recreating the classic game as an introduction to video game programming based on "Head First C#"'s Lab #3.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Now that I have fully implemented a fully functional, albeit simplistic gameplay design, I am focusing on optimizing the
game based on ideas from "Game Programming Algorithms and Techniques: A Platform-Agnostic Approach (Game Design)" by Sanjay 
Madhav and "Game Engine Architecture, 2nd Edition" by Jason Gregory. I have no intention of making this game any more than
what it now is.

  If anyone else wants to contribute to the game to make it more than what it now is or help me with optimizing it, then 
fork and push away! Just make sure your code is documented well and that you summerize your modifications and/or additions.

  I'll be updating this readme with optimizations currently and planned optimizations.
  
Note: None of the optimizations I am/will be doing are meant to actually improve the performance of this specific game. I'm
just practicing on it.

Current Optimizations:
None

Planned Optimizations:
1. Inheritance
2. Reduce input lag.
3. Multi-threading with Tasks.
4. Release settings changed to remove all debug info.
5. Runtime performance analysis for bottlenecks.
6. Use delta time.
